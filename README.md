This was my AP Computer Science Principles Create Performance Task: a clone of the old Arcade Breakout. It's finalized at this point; it could use more work and levels, but I believe it to be quite polished as for what it was intended to be. I loved making it, and it was all from scratch code-wise, with the exception of a few flaws I had to fix with the Internet's help, as well as the images and audio files.
